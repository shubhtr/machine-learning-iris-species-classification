# Machine Learning Iris Species Classification
#### by Shubhrendu Tripathi

This project applies machine learning (classification) on Fisher's Iris Data to predict the species of a new sample of Iris flower 
using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier algorithm. 

## Setup

* Python 3.10
* scikit-learn 1.3
* pandas 2.0
* numpy 1.25
* plotly 5.16

## Dataset

The dataset for this project originates from 
the [UCI (University of California Irvine ) Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). 
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician 
and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper, 
_"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis"_.

### Features in the Dataset

* Length of the sepals (in centimeters)
* Width of the sepals (in centimeters)
* Length of the petals (in centimeters)
* Width of the petals (in centimeters)
